  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_<your_api_key>"
```

  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_<your_api_key>"
```

**Monthly winners**

  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_<your_api_key>"
```

## Use cases

**Discover new traders to follow**
```bash
# Get top 20 performers this week
curl -X GET "https://api.cope.capital/v1/leaderboard?timeframe=7d&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_<your_api_key>" | jq -r '.leaderboard[].handle'
```

**Build a watchlist from top performers**
1. Get leaderboard handles
2. Use `cope-watchlists` skill to create a watchlist with the top handles
3. Monitor their activity with `cope-activity` skill

**Track follower growth**
- Compare `followers` counts over time to see which traders are gaining popularity
- High follower count often correlates with consistent performance

## Performance metrics

**Understanding the numbers:**
- High `pnl` = Profitable in the timeframe
- High `num_trades` + positive PnL = Active and successful
- High `total_volume` = Large position sizes or very active
- `swap_count` > `num_trades` = Multiple entries/exits per position
- High `followers` = Community-recognized trader

**Quality indicators:**
- Consistent positive PnL across timeframes
- Growing follower count
- Reasonable trade frequency (not just luck on a few trades)

## Notes
